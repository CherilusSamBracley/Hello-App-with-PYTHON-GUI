# Hello-App-with-PYTHON-GUI
Hello App with Python using Tkinter
This is a simple project that i created in order to practice my tkinter skills with a python script.
You will find two widgets: one button and a label text (or quit simply text)
When you will clik one the button you will see the Label text with a message "Hello world"
